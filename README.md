# Basic-Python-For-Loop

The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).  This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.  With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
